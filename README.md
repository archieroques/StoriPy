# StoriPy
Tool for grabbing tweets with a given hashtag from the day - a quick n dirty Storify replacement sorta thingy 

You gotta have tweepy installed: `pip3 install tweepy`. You also need Twitter API keys which you can get from https://apps.twitter.com (you'll need to create a new app and click on the 'Keys and Access Tokens' tab, then copy the strings of characters into the text)

And run it with the necessary permissions to create files. 

You can change the hashtag it looks for by swapping '#makershour' out for something else, and you can do past dates and times too if you remove the `break` from the `else` bit. 

Good luck and have fun :)
